Description: # Flight Scheduling Algorithms
        
        The following repository contains code for the paper "XYZ" .Few flight scheduling algorithms have been implemented. The experiments were performed in PyPy3.7 and CPython 3.8.10.
        
        **Algorithms**:
        - Hill Climbing
        - Random Search
        - Simulated Annealing
        - Genetic Algorithm
        - Genetic Algorithm in Reverse Mode
        - Genetic  Algorithm with Reversals
        - Iterated Chaining
          
        
        
        # Getting Started
        The instructions for setup are mentioned in setup directory. Alternatively, you can setup using this bash script. A requirements file is provided just in case.
        The script creates and activates an PyPy conda virtual environment with all libraries and dependencies.
        ```
        cd ./setup.sh
        source setup.sh
        ```
        # Run
        Execute the script to run the experiments.
        ```
        pypy mp.py 
        OR
        pypy flightscheduling.py
        ```
