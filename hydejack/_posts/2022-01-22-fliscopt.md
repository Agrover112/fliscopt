FLIght SCheduling OPTimization ðŸ›« or *fliscopt* is a simple optimization library for flight scheduling and related problems in the discrete domain. The library supports plotting, asynchronous multiprocessing, and unimodal optimization benchmarks.
The following repository contains code for the paper "XYZ". The experiments were performed in **PyPy3.7** and **CPython 3.8.10.**

Following algorithms have been implemented and test as of date:

**Algorithms**:
- Hill Climbing 
- Random Search 
- Simulated Annealing 
- Genetic Algorithm 
- Genetic Algorithm in Reverse Mode
- Genetic  Algorithm with Reversals
- Genetic Algorithm with Random Search as a Reversal/Reverse Process
- Iterated Chaining
