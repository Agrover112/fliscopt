## New sites
For new sites, the best way to get started with Hydejack is via the Starter Kit. 
It comes with a documented config file and example content that gets you started quickly.

If you have a GitHub account, fork the [Hydejack Starter Kit][hsc] repository. 
Otherwise [download the Starter Kit][src] and unzip them somewhere on your machine.

If you bought the __PRO Version__ of Hydejack, use the contents of the `starter-kit` folder instead.

In addition to the docs here, you can follow the quick start guide in the Starter Kit.

You can now jump to [running locally](#running-locally).

You can now also [![Deploy to Netlify][dtn]][nfy]{:.no-mark-external} directly.

## Existing sites
If you have an existing site that you'd like to upgrade to Hydejack you can install the theme via bundler.
Add the following to your `Gemfile`:

~~~ruby
# file: `Gemfile`
gem "jekyll-theme-hydejack"
~~~

If you bought the __PRO Version__ of Hydejack, copy the `#jekyll-theme-hydejack` folder into the root folder of your site,
and add the following to your `Gemfile` instead:

~~~ruby
# file: `Gemfile`
gem "jekyll-theme-hydejack", path: "./#jekyll-theme-hydejack"
~~~

The folder is prefixed with a `#` to indicate that this folder is different from regular Jekyll content. 
The `#` char was choosen specifically because it is on of the four characters ignored by Jekyll by default (`.`, `_` , `#`, `~`).
{:.note}

In your config file, change the `theme` to Hydejack:

~~~yml
# file: `_config.yml`
theme: jekyll-theme-hydejack
~~~

Hydejack comes with a default configuration file that takes care most of the configuration,
but it pays off to check out the example config file in the Starter Kit to see what's available.

You can now jump to [running locally](#running-locally).

### Troubleshooting
If your existing site combines theme files with your content (as did previous verisons of Hydejack/PRO),
make sure to delete the following folders:

- `_layouts`
- `_includes` 
- `_sass` 
- `assets`

The `assets` folder most likely includes theme files as well as your personal/content files. 
Make sure to only delete files that belong to the old theme!


## GitHub Pages
If you want to build your site on [GitHub Pages][ghp], check out the [`gh-pages` branch][gpb] in the Hydejack Starter Kit repo.

[ghp]: https://jekyllrb.com/docs/github-pages/
[gpb]: https://github.com/hydecorp/hydejack-starter-kit/tree/gh-pages

For existing sites, you can instead set the `remote_theme` key as follows:

```yml
# file: `_config.yml`
remote_theme: hydecorp/hydejack@v9.1.5
```

Make sure the `plugins` list contains `jekyll-include-cache` (create if it doesn't exist):
{:.note title="Important"}

```yml
# file: `_config.yml`
plugins:
  - jekyll-include-cache
```

To run this configuration locally, make sure the following is part of your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
# file: `Gemfile`
gem "github-pages", group: :jekyll_plugins
gem "jekyll-include-cache", group: :jekyll_plugins
```

Note that Hydejack has a reduced feature set when built on GitHub Pages. 
Specifically, using KaTeX math formulas doesn't work when built in this way.
{:.note}


## Running locally
Make sure you've `cd`ed into the directory where `_config.yml` is located.
Before running for the first time, dependencies need to be fetched from [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/):

~~~bash
$ bundle install
~~~

If you are missing the `bundle` command, you can install Bundler by running `gem install bundler`.
{:.note}

Now you can run Jekyll on your local machine:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

and point your browser to <http://localhost:4000> to see Hydejack in action.
