## Building locally
When building Hydejack it is important to set the environment variable `JEKYLL_ENV` to `production`.
Otherwise the output will not be minified. Building itself happens via Jekyll's `build` command.

~~~bash
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build
~~~

This will generate the finished static files in `_site`,
which can be deployed using the methods outlined in the [Jekyll Documentation][deploy].


## Building locally with latent semantic analysis
By default, related posts are simply the most recent posts.
Hydejack modifies this a bit, by showing the most recent posts of the same category or tag.
However, the results are still pretty "unrelated".
To provide better results, Jekyll supports [latent semantic analysis][lsa] via [`classifier-reborn`][crb]'s
[Latent Semantic Indexer][lsi]

To use the LSI, you first have to disable Hydejack's default behavior,
by setting `use_lsi: true` under the `hydejack` key in your config file.

~~~yml
# file: `_config.yml`
hydejack:
  use_lsi: true
~~~

Then, you have to run `jekyll build` with the `--lsi` flag:

~~~bash
$ JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build --lsi
~~~


Note that this may take a long time.
Once it is finished, the generated static files will be located in the `_site` directory,
which can be deployed using the methods outlined in the [Jekyll Documentation][deploy].


## GitHub Pages
If you're using the Starter Kit for GitHub pages, all you have to do is push your repository:

```bash
$ git add .
$ git commit "Update"
$ git push origin master
```

<!-- ## GitHub Pages
To deploy to GitHub Pages, the steps are:

~~~bash
$ cd _site
$ git init # you only need to do this once
$ git remote add origin <github_remote_url> # you only need to do this once
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Build"
$ git push origin master:<remote_branch>
$ cd ..
~~~

`github_remote_url`
: Find this on your repository's GitHub page.

`remote_branch`
: Either `master` for "user or organization pages", or `gh-pages` for "project pages"
