# Introduction


What is Fliscopt?
	Fliscopt is a short name for the term Flight Scheduling OptimizationðŸ›«  . It is a library you can use for scheduling flights which are round trips  from given locations to a given location and back.
  
  The Flight Scheduling problem in essence is a form of a [Travelling Salesman Problem(TSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem).
  
  Fliscopt takes care of the constraints imposed such as waiting time, departure time, cost of the flight,etc which form the part of the objective function.

## Why should I use it?
You can easily run novel variants of Genetic Algorithmâ€™s which have been tried and tested on benchmarks , to optimize for your given task. Moreover, fliscopt provides a simple interface which can be used to also learn about the algorithmâ€™s and optimize your given task at hand. Simply plug your own cost function in based on the convention and enjoy the power of optimization.

You can also use this for creating your own flight schedules by adding your own data, in the given [format]
(https://github.com/Agrover112/fliscopt/blob/master/data/flights.txt).

## How to use it?
Further the details are mentioned in the README.md, which explains beautifully how to install it as a package from PyPy or to clone it from the source.
