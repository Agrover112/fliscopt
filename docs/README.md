# About Fliscopt
### What is Fliscopt?
	Fliscopt is a short name for the term Flight Scheduling Optimization . It is a library you can use for scheduling flights which are round trips  from given locations to a given location and back. Fliscopt takes care of the constraints imposed such as waiting time, departure time, cost of the flight,etc. 

### Why should I use it?
You can easily run novel variants of Genetic Algorithm’s which have been tried and tested on benchmarks , to optimize for your given task. Moreover, fliscopt provides a simple interface which can be used to also learn about the algorithm’s and optimize your given task at hand. Simply plug your own cost function in based on the convention and enjoy the power of optimization.

### How to use it?
All the details are mentioned in the README.md, which explains beautifully how to install it as a package from PyPy or to clone it from the source.
